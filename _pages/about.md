Previously, I obtained my BS of Applied and Computational Mathematics from [Caltech](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/).

## research interests
I am excited about *discrete differential geometry* and its applications to 
computer graphics.

## hobbies
My hobbies will go here.

## fun facts
These are secret...for now.
