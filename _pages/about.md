## about me
I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) advised by Professor [Edward Chien](https://cs-people.bu.edu/edchien/).
Previously, I obtained my BS in Applied and Computational Mathematics from [Caltech](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) thanks to the [Questbridge National College Match Scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/).

## research interests
I am currently highly interested in all of the different ways we can use *differential
geometry* and *geometric measure theory* to better understand the geometric principles
underlying different physical phenomena.
In particular, I am interested in how we can translate this understanding
in a way that suitable for computation through the use of *discrete differential geometry*. 


## hobbies
In my free time, I enjoy [_strength traning_](https://startingstrength.com/about), listening to music, watching baseball (_Go Dodgers_!), and _recently_ travelling through the
east coast.

## fun facts
* My favorite song is [_Voice of the Soul_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2EJ1AqPIPg) by Death.
* My heaviest squat and deadlift were 415lbs and 425lbs respectively!
* I was a _Marble_ at Caltech.
