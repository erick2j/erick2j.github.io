## about me
I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) advised by Professor [Edward Chien](https://cs-people.bu.edu/edchien/).
Previously, I obtained my BS in Applied and Computational Mathematics from [Caltech](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/) thanks to the [Questbridge National College Match Scholarship](https://www.questbridge.org/).

## research interests
I am currently very excited about all of the different ways we can use *differential
geometry* and *geometric measure theory* to better understand physical phenomena.
In particular, I am deeply interested in how we can translate this understanding
onto computers through the use of *discrete differential geometry*. 

## hobbies
My hobbies will go here.

## fun facts
* My favorite song is [_Voice of the Soul_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2EJ1AqPIPg) by Death.
* My heaviest squat and deadlift were 415lbs and 425lbs respectively!
* I was a _Marble_ at Caltech.
