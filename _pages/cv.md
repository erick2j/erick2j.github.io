Research Interests
==================
I am currently highly interested in all of the different ways we can use *differential
geometry* and *geometric measure theory* to better understand the geometric principles
underlying different physical phenomena.
In particular, I am interested in how we can translate this understanding
in a way that suitable for computation through the use of *discrete differential geometry*. 

Education
======
* B.S. in Applied and Computation Mathematics, *California Institute of Technology*, 2023
* Ph.D in Computer Science, *Boston University*, 2028 (expected)
